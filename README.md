# Age_calculator
The "Age Calculator" project is a simple web application designed to determine a user's age based on their date of birth. It provides a user-friendly interface where users can input their birthdate and receive their current age as output.
Key Features:

Date Input:

The application features a date picker (<input type="date">) allowing users to easily select their date of birth from a calendar interface. This eliminates the need for manual text entry and potential formatting errors.
Age Calculation:

A "Calculate Age" button (<button id="btn">) triggers the age calculation process. Upon clicking this button, the application's JavaScript code (presumably in app.js) will process the selected birthdate.
Age Display:

The calculated age is presented to the user in a clear and concise manner within a designated area (<p id="result">). The initial placeholder text indicates that the output will likely include both the numerical age and the unit (years).
User Interface (UI):

Clean and Simple: The HTML suggests a straightforward UI with a single form for inputting the birthdate and a button for triggering the calculation.
Informative: The <h1> tag clearly states the purpose of the application ("Age Calculator").
Clear Instructions: The <label> provides clear instructions to the user: "Enter your date of birth."
Organized: The content is contained within div elements which would allow for styling and layout control.
Responsive: The use of <meta name="viewport"> suggests the intention of the web page to be responsive to screen size.
The project aims to provide a basic yet functional web tool for calculating a person's age. It's a good exercise for practicing fundamental web development concepts,such as HTML,CSS,JAVASCRIPT.
